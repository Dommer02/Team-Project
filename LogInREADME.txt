VLMS Project - Login Menu

Login Choice: This choice asks for the user's username and password. If valid, the user is sent to the user menu. If invalid, it produces an error and asks for choices again.

Register Choice: This choice will ask the user for a username. If it is unique, then it asks for a password and saves both to a users.txt file via a map. If it is not unique, then it produces an error and asks for the choices again. 

Exit Choice: This exits the program



User Session: This needs to be the User Menu if they are not admin. If they are admin then this should be the admin menu.
